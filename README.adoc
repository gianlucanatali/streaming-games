= Streaming Games
:imagesdir: adocs/images/


*Streaming Games* is the funniest application that you ever see while applying principles of streaming analytics using https://confluent.cloud[Confluent Cloud]. Built around the different games, this application ingest and store events from the game into Kafka topics and allow you to process them in near real-time using https://www.confluent.io/product/flink/[Apache Flink]. In order to keep you focused this application is based on fully managed services in Confluent Cloud for both the Apache Kafka cluster (using Confluent Cloud KORA engine) as well as Flink.

To implement streaming analytics in the game we built a scoreboard using Flink. The scoreboard will be a table containing aggregated metrics of the players such as their highest score, the highest level achieved, and the number of times that the player loses. As new events arrive the scoreboard gets instantly updated by the continuous queries that keep processing those events as they happen.

== What you are going to need?

* *Java and Maven* - The UI layer of the application relies on two APIs that are implemented using https://openjdk.java.net/[Java], therefore you will need to have Java 11+ installed to build the source-code. The build itseld is implemented using https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], and it is triggered automatically by Terraform.
* Install jq on your local computer
* *Confluent Cloud CLI* - During the demo setup, a bash script will set up the whole Confluent Cloud environment for you. To do that it will need to have the Confluent Cloud CLI installed locally. You can find instructions about how to install it https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/cli/index.html[here]. v1.7.0 or later is required, logged in with the ``--save`` argument which saves your Confluent Cloud user login credentials or refresh token (in the case of SSO) to the local ``netrc`` file.
* *Confluent Cloud account* - If you do not have a Confluent Cloud account, you can create it with instructions below. 
* *Terraform (0.14+)* - The application is automatically created using https://www.terraform.io[Terraform]. Besides having Terraform installed locally, will need to provide your cloud provider credentials so Terraform can create and manage the resources for you.
* *AWS account* - This demo/Workshop runs on AWS

== Workshop or Demo?
Choose your story! If you prefer to follow the different steps in a workshop style follow the instructions https://gianlucanatali.github.io/streaming-games/index.html[here]. Otherwise for a more traditional demo keep reading below!


== Pre-requisites

[IMPORTANT]
====
Follow this part carefully before the demo/workshop!
====

=== Step 1. Install workshop dependencies

Run the following command to install workshop dependencies
[source,bash]
----
brew install terraform \
mvn \
jq \
awscli \
confluent-cli
----


=== Step 2. Signup for Confluent Cloud

You can Create a Confluent Cloud Account following this link: https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/?utm_campaign=tm.campaigns_cd.Q223_EMEA_AWS-Pacman-Workshop&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=workshop[Try Confluent Cloud For Free (Games Workshop)]

If you want to create a Confluent Cloud account from the *AWS Marketplace*, follow this link:
https://www.confluent.io/partner/amazon-web-services/?utm_campaign=tm.campaigns_cd.mp-workshop-pacman-emea-awsmarketplace&utm_medium=marketingemail[Try Confluent Cloud For Free - Sign up from AWS Marketplace (Games Workshop)]

==== Step 2a. Create a Cloud API Key

1. Open the https://confluent.cloud/settings/api-keys/create[Confluent Cloud Console] and click **Granular access** tab, and then click **Next**.
2. Click **Create a new one to create** tab. Enter the new service account name (`tf_runner`), then click **Next**.
3. The Cloud API key and secret are generated for the `tf_runner` service account. Save your Cloud API key and secret in a secure location. You will need this API key and secret **to use the Confluent Terraform Provider**.
4. https://confluent.cloud/settings/org/assignments[Assign] the `OrganizationAdmin` role to the `tf_runner` service account by following https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/access-management/access-control/cloud-rbac.html#add-a-role-binding-for-a-user-or-service-account[this guide].

image::https://github.com/confluentinc/terraform-provider-confluent/raw/master/docs/images/OrganizationAdmin.png[Assigning the OrganizationAdmin role to tf_runner service account]

==== Step 2b. Configure the Confluent CLI

1. Log in to the Confluent Cloud CLI:

[source,bash]
----
confluent login --save
----

The --save flag will save your Confluent Cloud login credentials to the ~/.netrc file.

== Step 3. Clone this repo
First things first, clone this github repo to your local machine (Use your Terminal):

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/lyuen-confluent/streaming-games.git
----

== Step 4. Configure the deployment

The whole workshop creation is scripted. The script will leverage Terraform to:

* As mentioned before the application uses a Kafka cluster running in a fully managed service for Apache Kafka. Therefore the first thing it will provision is Confluent Cloud resources using the Confluent Cloud CLI. If you are interested in how you can create a cluster in Confluent Cloud via the Web UI have a look at our https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/cloud-quickstart/index.html[Quick Start for Apache Kafka using Confluent Cloud].
* Spin up the other resources needed in AWS

Run the following steps to configure the workshop

1. Create the demo.cfg file using the example provided in the config folder
+
[source,bash]
----
cp config/demo.cfg.example config/demo.cfg
----
+
2. Provide the required information on the 'demo.cfg' file
+
[source,bash]
----
export TF_VAR_aws_profile="<AWS_PROFILE>"
export TF_VAR_aws_region="eu-west-2"
export TF_VAR_schema_registry_region="eu-central-1"
export TF_VAR_confluent_cloud_api_key=="<CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY>"
export TF_VAR_confluent_cloud_api_secret="<CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET>"
----
we advice using the utility https://github.com/Nike-Inc/gimme-aws-creds[gimme-aws-creds] if you use Okta to login in AWS. You can also use the https://granted.dev/[granted] CLI for AWS creds. 
Amend any of the config as you see fit for your preference (Like the aws region or Schema registry Region)
+
3. If you are not using gimme-aws-creds, create a credential file as described https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#shared-configuration-and-credentials-files[here]. 
The file in ``~/.aws/credentials`` should look like this (An example below)
+
[source,bash]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
----
You can set ``TF_VAR_aws_profile="default"`` in the ``demo.cfg`` file

== Step 5. Deploying the application

The application is essentially a set of link:https://github.com/gianlucanatali/demo-scene/tree/master/streaming-games/games/2048[HTML/CSS/JS files] that forms a microsite that can be hosted statically anywhere. But for the sake of coolness we will deploy this microsite in a S3 bucket from AWS. This bucket will be created in the same region selected for the Confluent Cloud cluster to ensure that the application will be co-located. The application will emit events that will be processed by a event handler implemented as an API Gateway which uses a Lambda function as backend. This event handler API receives the events and writes them into Kafka.

image::arch-flink.png[align="left"]

Please note that during deployment, the script takes care of creating the required Kafka topics, Flink statements and the materialized view using ksqlDB. Therefore, there is no need to manually create them.

1. Start the demo creation
+
[source,bash]
----
./start.sh
----
+
2. At the end of the provisioning the Output with the demo endpoint will be shown. Paste the demo url in your browser and start playing!
+
[source,bash]
----
Outputs:

Game = https://d************.cloudfront.net/
----
+
3. Wait for the content to be available

> **Note**
> It could take a bit of time for the content to be available via cloudfront. If accessing the link returned by the script you see an error message like the one below, don't worry: just give it some more minutes and try the link again. Make sure you are not hitting refresh, as cloudfront might have sent you to a different url. It can take up to 1hr for the cloudfront distribution to be available.

image::error-cloud-front.png[]

You can try to speed up this process using the trick explained in this medium article: https://medium.com/the-scale-factory/is-your-cloudfront-distribution-stuck-in-progress-7e3aead1337b[Is your CloudFront distribution stuck “in progress”?]



=== Check the scoreboard

First things first: Play with the game and share your game link with your friends to populate data! 
You can make sure the data is flowing into the Confluent by following the steps below: 

1. In Confluent UI go to the environment and the cluster within it, created by the terraform script - should start with with ``streaming-games`` 

2. Click on *Topics* and choose ``USER_GAME`` topic 

image::topic-user-game.png[]

As users engage with the 2048 game, two types of events will be generated. The first is referred to as the "User Game" event and includes information about the user's current game state, such as their score, level, and remaining lives. This event will be triggered every time the user's score changes, advances to a new level, or loses a life.

The second type of event is called the "User Losses" event, which as the name suggests, captures data related to the user's loss in the game. This event is triggered when the player reaches the game-over state.
The scoreboard can be visualized in real time by clicking on the *SCOREBOARD* link in the 2048 game (top right corner). It is also available in the other games. 

image::scoreboard.png[]

To build a scoreboard out of this, we created a real-time streaming analytics pipeline that transform these raw events into into a table with the scoreboard that is updated in near real-time.

=== the Flink statements that built this streaming pipeline

To implement the pipeline we used Flink. You can see below the queries for your reference.

=== LOSSES_PER_USER Table 
A table to count the number of losses for each player.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE LOSSES_PER_USER (
    `USER` STRING,
    `GAME_NAME` STRING,
    `TOTAL_LOSSES` INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (`USER`, `GAME_NAME`) NOT ENFORCED
) WITH (
    'kafka.partitions' = '1'
);

INSERT INTO LOSSES_PER_USER
SELECT 
    `user`,
    game_name,
    cast(count(game_name) as int) as total_losses 
FROM USER_LOSSES GROUP BY `user`,game_name;
----

=== STATS_PER_USER Table
A table that joins USER_GAME with LOSSES_PER_USER

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE STATS_PER_USER (
    `USER` STRING,
    `GAME_NAME` STRING,
    `HIGHEST_SCORE` INT,
    `HIGHEST_LEVEL` INT,
    `TOTAL_LOSSES` INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (`USER`, `GAME_NAME`) NOT ENFORCED
) WITH (
    'kafka.partitions' = '1',
    'kafka.cleanup-policy' = 'delete-compact' 
);

INSERT INTO STATS_PER_USER
SELECT
    UG.`user` AS `USER`,
    UG.game_name AS GAME_NAME,
    MAX(UG.score) AS HIGHEST_SCORE,
    MAX(UG.level) AS HIGHEST_LEVEL,
    MAX (
        CASE 
            WHEN LPU.TOTAL_LOSSES IS NULL THEN CAST (0 AS INT)
            ELSE LPU.TOTAL_LOSSES
        END
    ) AS TOTAL_LOSSES
FROM
    USER_GAME UG
    LEFT JOIN LOSSES_PER_USER LPU ON UG.`user` = LPU.`USER` AND UG.game_name = LPU.GAME_NAME
GROUP BY 
    UG.`user`, UG.game_name;
----

You can check the status of the running Flink Statements by clicking "Flink (preview)" and then "Flink statements" in your Confluent Cloud environment:

image::flink-running-statements.png[]

Finally, we use ksqlDB to materialize the STATS_PER_USER table created by Flink with a source table:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE SOURCE TABLE STATS_PER_USER 
WITH ( 
    KAFKA_TOPIC = 'STATS_PER_USER',
    FORMAT = 'AVRO');
----

image::arch-flink-ksqldb.png[]

ksqlDB supports link:https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/0.14.0-ksqldb/concepts/queries/pull/[Pull queries], where you can get the results for a query in a more traditional fashion (instead of Push queries).

A query to the STATS_PER_USER table is sent to ksqlDB, to get all the players scores for the selected game.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  ROWKEY->USER,
  HIGHEST_SCORE,
  HIGHEST_LEVEL,
  TOTAL_LOSSES
FROM STATS_PER_USER 
WHERE ROWKEY->GAME_NAME='2048';
----

== Step 7. Destroy the resources (save money!)

The great thing about Cloud resources is that you can spin the up and down with few commands. Once you are finished with this worksho/demo , remember to destroy the resources you created today, to avoid incuring in charges if you are not planning to use this. You can always spin it up again anytime you want (uncomment the run_as_workshop variable in the config file if you want to automate the creation of Flink statements and ksqlDB queries, so you can demo the app without any manual effort)! 


*Note:* When you are done with the application, you can automatically destroy all the resources created using the command below:

[source,bash]
----
./stop.sh
----
